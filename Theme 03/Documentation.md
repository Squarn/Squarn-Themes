Theme 03 is a simple (in looks) grid theme with a 1, 2, or 3 column layout style and 2-column Permalink layout. It uses Masonry for it's grid, Paul Irish's Infinite Scroll, and Photoset Extended to format its Photosets. All color elements are configurable. The header contains vertically aligned title, tagline, avatar, and description.

Notes and tags are displayed in a slide-up div when you hover over an individual post. If you wish to display tags and notes below the post content, you can toggle to change it. If the post has no notes and no tags, the permalink can be accessed by clicking the "+" in the hover meta menu.
