I take a bit longer to develop a theme because I try to make them as dynamic as possible. What does this mean? I don't make themes for one type of person or user. I try to make all colors and elements customizable. Text formatting is never extensive &mdash;, you won't fine me saying "only one line of text here". This is also why I don't do fandom themes or, for lack of a better word, "themed" theme. I try to test many different configurations for each theme in order to make them universal, but if you need help getting something working on a theme, please drop me an ask. Testing on your blog would also be very helpful!

This theme (6) externally uses jQuery, a jQuert script (Particleground), and 3 Google Fonts: Arbutus Slab, Fjalla One, and Karla.

I number themes based on when I started them (to save myself confusion), not by when they are published, and including blog themes that are not necessarily available to release. You might think of their number as a name, rather than a position in a list. Squarn blog themes are not published because they are not written to be customizable, and I wouldn't want to put out something that would be difficult for anyone to customize.
