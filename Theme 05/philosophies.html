Squarn is a dorky little theme blog run by Psychosomatica. My themes aren't anything special, but my drive comingles with the unique challenge/muscle flexed by creating Tumblr themes for: Several media types, people who don't know anything about html or code, people who don't know how to use the Tumblr theme GUI, using the minimum of variables to puppeteer many many code variables. Tumblr themes are challenging due to their limitations, or even, their LACK of limitations. I also love that I can potentially create something someone will use and like... And fiddle with/customize. 

I take a bit long to develop a theme because I try to make them as dynamic as possible. I don't make themes for one type of person or user, and don't intend for them to come out one way, or even like the live preview. I try to make all colors and elements customizable. Text formatting is never extensive &mdash;you won't find me saying "only one line of text here" on a menu. This is also why I don't do fandom themes or, for lack of a better word, "themed" themes. I try to test many different configurations and media size/types for each theme in order to make them universal, but if you need help getting something working on a theme, please drop me an ask. Testing on your blog would also be very helpful!

<b>Info</b>
This theme (#6) externally uses jQuery, a jQuery script (Particleground), and 3 Google-hosted Fonts: Fjalla One, Karla, and Source Code Pro.

I number themes based on when I started them (to save myself confusion), not by when they are published, and including blog themes that are not necessarily available to release. You might think of their number as a name, rather than a position in a list. Squarn blog themes are not published because they are not written to be customizable, and I wouldn't want to put out something that would be difficult for anyone to customize.
